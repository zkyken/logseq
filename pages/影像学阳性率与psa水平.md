## Depending on the imaging modality of choice, the PSA level in the biochemical recurrent setting is important:
* A [[bone scan]] as a <1% sensitivity when the PSA is <10 ng/mL
* A whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scan ([[MRI]]) has a sensitivity of 39% for a PSA <2 ng/mL
* A choline Positron Emission Tomography- Computed Tomography ([[PET-CT]]) scan has a sensitivity of 5-24%  for a PSA of <1 ng/mL
* A fluciclovine PET-CT has a sensitivity of <50% for a PSA < 1 ng/mL
* In a prostate-specific membrane antigen ([[PSMA]]) PET-CT study among 332 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer (97% after radical prostatectomy), Ceci et al.1 found that 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT detection rate for disease was 53.6% (CI 95% 48.1%-59.1%).
* the detection rate among patients with persisting detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy was 64.5%.
## The EAU guidelines state that

* in the setting of PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy a PSMA PET-CT may be obtained if the PSA level is > 0.2 ng/mL and if the results will influence subsequent treatment decisions (level of evidence 2b, strength rating: weak).
* In cases where PSMA PET-CT is not available, and the PSA level is >= 1 ng/mL, clinicians should perform a fluciclovine PET-CT or choline PET-CT if the results will influence subsequent treatment decisions (strength rating: weak).
