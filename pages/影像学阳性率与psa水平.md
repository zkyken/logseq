## Depending on the imaging modality of choice, the PSA level in the biochemical recurrent setting is important:

* A **bone scan** as a <1% sensitivity when the PSA is <10 ng/mL
* A **whole-body magnetic resonance imaging scan** (MRI) has a sensitivity of 39% for a PSA <2 ng/mL
* A **choline Positron Emission Tomography- Computed Tomography** ([[PET-CT]]) scan has a sensitivity of **5-24%  for a PSA of <1 ng/mL**
* **A fluciclovine PET-CT **has a sensitivity of <50% for a PSA < 1 ng/mL
