### [[EAU 2020]]: Limitations of [[PSMA]] Based on Prostate Cancer Biology
#### (UroToday.com) Prostate membrane antigen ([[PSMA]]) is a type 2 transmembrane protein with an enzymatic function of a folate hydrolase carboxypeptidase.
#### It is expressed in several tissues with different functions, including activity in Glial cells, modulating signal transduction pathway, in the small intestine, assisting in fulling absorption, and it has an uncertain role in the prostate (figure 1).
##### Figure 1 – The various roles of PSMA:

#### [[PSMA]] has significant clinical utility in prostate cancer, demonstrating detection rates for bone metastasis of 93.9% when PSA values are over two ng/ml in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer ( [[mCRPC]] ).
#### However, not all patients respond to [[PSMA]] targeting drugs, and there's even significant inter- and intra- patients' heterogeneity (Figure 2).
##### Figure 2 – [[PSMA]] heterogeneity:

#### The hypothesis is that [[PSMA]] facilitates folate transport in prostate cancer cells.
##### Its overexpression could represent an adaptive response to the increased requirement of folate.
##### Prostate cancer cells with DNA damage repair aberrations have increased DNA synthesis and repair.
##### Therefore, they need higher levels of [[PSMA]] to acquire folates so that they could increase the nucleotide pool.
#### Although not all patients express Membranous PSMA ( [[mPSMA]] ), the ones that do show higher levels of mPSMA expression were shown to be associated with having a higher Gleason grade and worse overall survival, demonstrating that [[PSMA]] has a prognostic role as well (Figure 3).
##### Figure 3 – Prognostic role of [[PSMA]] expression1:

#### When assessing the conversion of hormone-sensitive PCa to [[CRPC]], [[mPSMA]] expression increased in matched samples (figure 4).

#### [[mPSMA]] expression has been associated with deleterious DNR repair aberrations.
#### Although the presented data is retrospective and with relatively small sample size, these data do suggest that [[PSMA]] expression in [[mCRPC]] presents a degree of inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity.
#### Tumors with [[DNA damage repair mutations]] might be more likely to benefit from [[PSMA]] targeting agents.
#### Lastly, [[PSMA]] expression could reflect a "stressed" phenotype requiring a higher pool of folate.
#### Naturally, these data would need to be further evaluated in prospective and larger trials.

### [[EAU 2020]] : Biochemical Recurrence after Radical Prostatectomy
#### (UroToday.com) As part of a plenary presentation at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Virtual Annual Meeting assessing “Modern prostate cancer imaging in daily practice,” Annika Herlemann, MD, presented the case of a patient who developed biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy. At the time of presentation, he was 57 years old with a family history of prostate cancer in his father that was treated with external beam radiotherapy at the age of 72 with subsequent metastatic disease treated with androgen deprivation therapy. The patient had an initial prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 7.2 ng/mL which was subsequently repeated at 7.6 ng/mL. Digital rectal exam demonstrated no lesions, though TRUS demonstrated a 48cc gland with a hypoechoic lesion concerning extraprostatic extension. Subsequent 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a PiRADs 5 lesion in the left mid-gland with concerns for extraprostatic spread. The remainder of his medical history was relatively non-contributory, including open appendectomy, hypertension, and mild lower urinary tract symptoms treated with tamsulosin.

MRI targeted fusion biopsy showed GGG3 disease in 2/3 cores from the region of interest as well as GGG2 in 4 of 12 systemic cores. Staging investigations were negative so he proceeded to local therapy, opting for radical prostatectomy. He underwent RALP and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy with final pathology showing pT3a pN0 (0/16) Gleason score 4+3 (GGG3) prostate cancer with negative margins. His initial post-operative PSA was undetectable but approximately 1 year following surgery, he presented with a rising PSA. This was observed over the course of 6 months where it rose to 0.4 ng/mL and he underwent salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed and pelvis, along with 6 months of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. His PSA then became undetectable again but rose again just over 1 year following salvage radiotherapy.

To investigate this rising PSA, a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT was performed when his PSA was 0.7 ng/mL. As shown here, this showed no evidence of local recurrence and no bony lesions but a small, suspicious lymph node in the perirectal fat.

This was treated with a 35 Gy SBRT boost, without concurrent androgen deprivation. PSA then remained low, but detectable (0.1 ng/mL).

This case set the stage for subsequent presentations assessing the role of imaging first or treatment first in patients with biochemically recurrent disease.
