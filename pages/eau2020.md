### [[EAU 2020]]: Limitations of [[PSMA]] Based on Prostate Cancer Biology
#### Prostate membrane antigen ([[PSMA]]) is a type 2 transmembrane protein with an enzymatic function of a folate hydrolase carboxypeptidase.

   :END:
#### [[PSMA]]  is expressed in several tissues with different functions, including activity in Glial cells, modulating signal transduction pathway, in the small intestine, assisting in fulling absorption, and it has an uncertain role in the prostate (figure 1).
##### Figure 1 – The various roles of [[PSMA]] :

#### [[PSMA]] has significant clinical utility in prostate cancer, demonstrating detection rates for bone metastasis of 93.9% when PSA values are over 2 ng/ml in metastatic castration-resistant [[prostate cancer]] ( [[mCRPC]] ).
.
#### However, not all patients respond to [[PSMA]] targeting drugs, and there's even significant inter- and intra- patients' heterogeneity (Figure 2).
##### Figure 2 – [[PSMA]] heterogeneity:

#### The hypothesis is that [[PSMA]] facilitates folate transport in [[prostate cancer]] cells.
##### Its overexpression could represent an adaptive response to the increased requirement of folate.
##### Prostate cancer cells with DNA damage repair aberrations have increased DNA synthesis and repair.
##### Therefore, they need higher levels of [[PSMA]] to acquire folates so that they could increase the nucleotide pool.
#### Although not all patients express Membranous PSMA ( [[mPSMA]] ), the ones that do show higher levels of mPSMA expression were shown to be associated with having a higher Gleason grade and worse overall survival, demonstrating that [[PSMA]] has a prognostic role as well (Figure 3).
##### Figure 3 – Prognostic role of [[PSMA]] expression1:

#### When assessing the conversion of hormone-sensitive PCa to [[CRPC]], [[mPSMA]] expression increased in matched samples (figure 4).

#### [[mPSMA]] expression has been associated with deleterious DNR repair aberrations.
#### Although the presented data is retrospective and with relatively small sample size, these data do suggest that [[PSMA]] expression in [[mCRPC]] presents a degree of inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity.
#### Tumors with [[DNA damage repair mutations]] might be more likely to benefit from [[PSMA]] targeting agents.
#### Lastly, [[PSMA]] expression could reflect a "stressed" phenotype requiring a higher pool of folate.
#### Naturally, these data would need to be further evaluated in prospective and larger trials.

### [[EAU 2020]] : [[biochemical recurrence]] after Radical Prostatectomy
#### (UroToday.com) As part of a plenary presentation at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Virtual Annual Meeting assessing “Modern prostate cancer imaging in daily practice,” [[Annika Herlemann]], MD, presented the case of a patient who developed [[biochemical recurrence]] following [[radical prostatectomy]].
#### At the time of presentation, he was 57 years old with a family history of prostate cancer in his father that was treated with external beam radiotherapy at the age of 72 with subsequent metastatic disease treated with androgen deprivation therapy.
#### The patient had an initial prostate specific antigen ([[PSA]]) of 7.2 ng/mL which was subsequently repeated at 7.6 ng/mL.
#### Digital rectal exam demonstrated no lesions, though TRUS demonstrated a 48cc gland with a hypoechoic lesion concerning extraprostatic extension.
#### Subsequent 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a [[PiRADs]] 5 lesion in the left mid-gland with concerns for extraprostatic spread.
#### The remainder of his medical history was relatively non-contributory, including open appendectomy, hypertension, and mild lower urinary tract symptoms treated with tamsulosin.
#### MRI targeted fusion biopsy showed GGG3 disease in 2/3 cores from the region of interest as well as GGG2 in 4 of 12 systemic cores.
#### Staging investigations were negative so he proceeded to local therapy, opting for radical prostatectomy.
#### He underwent RALP and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy with final pathology showing pT3a pN0 (0/16) Gleason score 4+3 (GGG3) prostate cancer with negative margins.
#### His initial post-operative PSA was undetectable but approximately 1 year following surgery, he presented with a rising PSA. This was observed over the course of 6 months where it rose to 0.4 ng/mL and he underwent salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed and pelvis, along with 6 months of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. His PSA then became undetectable again but rose again just over 1 year following salvage radiotherapy.

To investigate this rising PSA, a prostate-specific membrane antigen ( [[PSMA]] ) PET/CT was performed when his PSA was 0.7 ng/mL.
#### As shown here, this showed no evidence of local recurrence and no bony lesions but a small, suspicious lymph node in the perirectal fat.
##### ![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology9fbf0997e29e44db8eaa47caa673521f.png)
#### This was treated with a 35 Gy [[SBRT]] boost, without concurrent androgen deprivation. PSA then remained low, but detectable (0.1 ng/mL).
#### This case set the stage for subsequent presentations assessing the role of imaging first or treatment first in patients with biochemically recurrent disease.

### [[EAU 2020]] : A Prospective, Open, Multicentre, Phase II Clinical Trial of Bicalutamide Alone or With Addition of Docetaxel in Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer With a Rising PSA ([[SPCG-14]])
#### (UroToday.com) As part of the “Game-changing Session 4” plenary session at the European Association of Urology (EAU)  Virtual Annual Meeting, Dr. Josefsson presented data from the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG) trial 14, a prospective, open, multicentre, phase II clinical trial of bicalutamide alone or with the addition of docetaxel in nonmetastatic prostate cancer with a rising PSA.
#### Docetaxel was the first agent with a proven survival benefit for patients with advanced prostate cancer, beginning with the metastatic castration-resistant disease space (TAX-327) and more recently demonstrating benefit in the metastatic castration sensitive space ([[CHAARTED]] and [[STAMPEDE]]).
#### Since the introduction of docetaxel for advanced prostate cancer, advanced androgen axis targeting agents including abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, darolutamide, and apalutamide have demonstrated benefit in advanced prostate cancer. These agents have been assessed among patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant disease (as well as in more advanced metastatic prostate cancer), though, to date, docetaxel has not been tested in this disease space.
#### Dr. Josefsson highlight first the study schema. Patients could be enrolled in [[SPCG-14]] if they had PSA relapse after curative intent radiotherapy or radiotherapy or if they had not received previous curative-intent treatments.
#### The inclusion criteria differed somewhat in these three groups but in each case required a PSA doubling time of less than 12 months. Further details of inclusion criteria are highlighted in the figure below.
##### ![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology/9cb16d9194b74ebe85b9a10f8cb0531b.png)
#### Following assessed eligibility, patients were then randomized in a 1:1 fashion to bicalutamide 150mg once daily or bicalutamide 150mg once daily plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for a total of 10 cycles. Among 345 accrued patients, 174 were randomized to the bicalutamide alone arm and 171 were randomized to the addition of docetaxel.
#### The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, defined as a PSA of more than 2mg/mL above nadir, metastasis, or death due to any cause.
#### Patients were accrued at 19 sites across Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands with 5 sites enrolling 269 (78%) of all included patients.
#### As would be expected in a randomized trial in this disease space, median age was 68 years and most had ECOG 0 performance status (91%). The majority at PSA doubling time of <6 months (62%) while the remainder had PSA doubling time of 6-12 months. The median absolute PSA value was 3.8 ng/mL (interquartile range 1.8 to 9.6 ng/mL). The majority of patients had Gleason grade 7 or lower (73%) with 26% having Gleason grade 8 or higher. Nearly 90% (89.3%) of patients had curative-intent treatment before inclusion.
##### ![null](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology/cf5a523edbd945788f3087570547451e.png)
#### Over a median following up of 36 months, progression within 5 years occurred in 46% of all patients with metastasis in 15% and death in 10%. Among those with no progression, median follow-up was longer at 47 months.
#### Using the authors' aggregate definition of progression-free survival, they found significantly improved [[PFS]] for patients who receiving bicalutamide plus docetaxel as compared to bicalutamide alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.99).
####![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology/d4af0caca3d14f95b5ddc4327d0df447.png)
#### In subgroup analysis, this effect was consistent for patients who had or did not have previous curative-intent treatment, for those with PSA doubling time less than 6 months of 6-12 months, and those aged younger than 68 years or 68 years and older.
#### Assessing safety outcomes, the authors found that 70% of patients received at least 6 cycles of docetaxel with a median of 7 cycle administered. 45 patients representing 26% of the study cohort experience neutropenic fever or infection as a serious adverse event and 85 (62% of randomized patients) terminated docetaxel treatment as a result of adverse events or serious adverse events.
#### Dr. Josefsson concluded by highlighting that the addition of docetaxel to bicalutamide reduced time to progression by 28%. Whether this translates into differences in metastasis-free survival or overall survival will require a longer follow-up of this study cohort.
#### Given the changes in the treatment landscape, including the approval of enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide in this disease space due to proven benefits in metastasis-free survival (and, more recently at this years ASCO meeting, in overall survival), it is unclear how the demonstrated benefits in progression-free survival here will translate into clinical decision making. However, it is worth noting that patients in the control arms of the trials of androgen receptor agents received placebo rather than the first generation non-steroidal antiandrogen administered in this trial.
