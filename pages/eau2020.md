#### Prostate membrane antigen ([[PSMA]]) is a type 2 transmembrane protein with an enzymatic function of a folate hydrolase carboxypeptidase. 
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: 5f262ee3-87be-4cea-bd6f-081db2f93b4b
   :END:
#### [[PSMA]]  is expressed in several tissues with different functions, including activity in Glial cells, modulating signal transduction pathway, in the small intestine, assisting in fulling absorption, and it has an uncertain role in the prostate (figure 1).
##### Figure 1 – The various roles of [[PSMA]] :

![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urologyef9b35f6e36f40f2b1e7e9f77c217031.png)
#### [[PSMA]] has significant clinical utility in prostate cancer, demonstrating detection rates for bone metastasis of 93.9% when PSA values are over 2 ng/ml in metastatic castration-resistant [[prostate cancer]] ( [[mCRPC]] ).
.
#### However, not all patients respond to [[PSMA]] targeting drugs, and there's even significant inter- and intra- patients' heterogeneity (Figure 2).
##### Figure 2 – [[PSMA]] heterogeneity:

![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology355d374fbb3243bdb7a18a5376a13f45.png)
#### The hypothesis is that [[PSMA]] facilitates folate transport in [[prostate cancer]] cells.
##### Its overexpression could represent an adaptive response to the increased requirement of folate.
##### Prostate cancer cells with DNA damage repair aberrations have increased DNA synthesis and repair.
##### Therefore, they need higher levels of [[PSMA]] to acquire folates so that they could increase the nucleotide pool.
#### Although not all patients express Membranous PSMA ( [[mPSMA]] ), the ones that do show higher levels of mPSMA expression were shown to be associated with having a higher Gleason grade and worse overall survival, demonstrating that [[PSMA]] has a prognostic role as well (Figure 3).
##### Figure 3 – Prognostic role of [[PSMA]] expression1:

![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology663ed1440f844f1e9adf66d5b7cb203f.png)
#### When assessing the conversion of hormone-sensitive PCa to [[CRPC]], [[mPSMA]] expression increased in matched samples (figure 4).
##### Figure 4 – [[mPSMA]] protein expression from hormone-sensitive to [[CRPC]] – matched samples:

#### [[mPSMA]] expression has been associated with deleterious DNR repair aberrations.
#### Although the presented data is retrospective and with relatively small sample size, these data do suggest that [[PSMA]] expression in [[mCRPC]] presents a degree of inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity.
#### Tumors with [[DNA damage repair mutations]] might be more likely to benefit from [[PSMA]] targeting agents.
#### Lastly, [[PSMA]] expression could reflect a "stressed" phenotype requiring a higher pool of folate.
#### Naturally, these data would need to be further evaluated in prospective and larger trials.

### [[EAU 2020]] : [[biochemical recurrence]] after Radical Prostatectomy
#### (UroToday.com) As part of a plenary presentation at the European Association of Urology (EAU) Virtual Annual Meeting assessing “Modern prostate cancer imaging in daily practice,” [[Annika Herlemann]], MD, presented the case of a patient who developed [[biochemical recurrence]] following [[radical prostatectomy]].
#### At the time of presentation, he was 57 years old with a family history of prostate cancer in his father that was treated with external beam radiotherapy at the age of 72 with subsequent metastatic disease treated with androgen deprivation therapy.
#### The patient had an initial prostate specific antigen ([[PSA]]) of 7.2 ng/mL which was subsequently repeated at 7.6 ng/mL.
#### Digital rectal exam demonstrated no lesions, though TRUS demonstrated a 48cc gland with a hypoechoic lesion concerning extraprostatic extension.
#### Subsequent 3T multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a [[PiRADs]] 5 lesion in the left mid-gland with concerns for extraprostatic spread.
#### The remainder of his medical history was relatively non-contributory, including open appendectomy, hypertension, and mild lower urinary tract symptoms treated with tamsulosin.
#### MRI targeted fusion biopsy showed GGG3 disease in 2/3 cores from the region of interest as well as GGG2 in 4 of 12 systemic cores.
#### Staging investigations were negative so he proceeded to local therapy, opting for radical prostatectomy.
#### He underwent RALP and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy with final pathology showing pT3a pN0 (0/16) Gleason score 4+3 (GGG3) prostate cancer with negative margins.
#### His initial post-operative PSA was undetectable but approximately 1 year following surgery, he presented with a rising PSA. This was observed over the course of 6 months where it rose to 0.4 ng/mL and he underwent salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed and pelvis, along with 6 months of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy. His PSA then became undetectable again but rose again just over 1 year following salvage radiotherapy.

To investigate this rising PSA, a prostate-specific membrane antigen ( [[PSMA]] ) PET/CT was performed when his PSA was 0.7 ng/mL.
#### As shown here, this showed no evidence of local recurrence and no bony lesions but a small, suspicious lymph node in the perirectal fat.
##### ![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology9fbf0997e29e44db8eaa47caa673521f.png)
#### This was treated with a 35 Gy [[SBRT]] boost, without concurrent androgen deprivation. PSA then remained low, but detectable (0.1 ng/mL).
#### This case set the stage for subsequent presentations assessing the role of imaging first or treatment first in patients with biochemically recurrent disease.

### [[EAU 2020]] : A Prospective, Open, Multicentre, Phase II [[Clinical Trial]] of Bicalutamide Alone or With Addition of Docetaxel in Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer With a Rising PSA ([[SPCG-14]])
#### 
#### (UroToday.com) As part of the “Game-changing Session 4” plenary session at the European Association of Urology ([[EAU]])  Virtual Annual Meeting, Dr. Josefsson presented data from the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group (SPCG) trial 14, a prospective, open, multicentre, phase II clinical trial of [[bicalutamide]] alone or with the addition of [[docetaxel]] in nonmetastatic [[prostate cancer]] with a rising PSA.
#### Docetaxel was the first agent with a proven survival benefit for patients with [[advanced prostate cancer]] , beginning with the metastatic castration-resistant disease space ([[TAX-327]]) and more recently demonstrating benefit in the metastatic castration sensitive space ([[CHAARTED]] and [[STAMPEDE]]).
#### Since the introduction of [[docetaxel]] for [[advanced prostate cancer]], advanced androgen axis targeting agents including [[abiraterone]] acetate, [[enzalutamide]], [[darolutamide]], and [[apalutamide]] have demonstrated benefit in advanced prostate cancer. These agents have been assessed among patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant disease (as well as in more advanced metastatic prostate cancer), though, to date, docetaxel has not been tested in this disease space.
#### Dr. Josefsson highlight first the study schema. Patients could be enrolled in [[SPCG-14]] if they had PSA relapse after curative intent radiotherapy or radiotherapy or if they had not received previous curative-intent treatments.
#### The inclusion criteria differed somewhat in these three groups but in each case required a PSA doubling time ([[PSADT]]) of less than 12 months. Further details of inclusion criteria are highlighted in the figure below.
##### ![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology/9cb16d9194b74ebe85b9a10f8cb0531b.png)
#### Following assessed eligibility, patients were then randomized in a 1:1 fashion to [[bicalutamide]] 150mg once daily or bicalutamide 150mg once daily plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for a total of 10 cycles. Among 345 accrued patients, 174 were randomized to the bicalutamide alone arm and 171 were randomized to the addition of [[docetaxel]] .
#### The primary endpoint was progression-free survival ( [[PFS]] ), defined as a PSA of more than 2mg/mL above nadir, metastasis, or death due to any cause.
#### Patients were accrued at 19 sites across Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands with 5 sites enrolling 269 (78%) of all included patients.
#### As would be expected in a randomized trial in this disease space, median age was 68 years and most had ECOG 0 performance status (91%). The majority at PSA doubling time ( [[PSADT]] )of <6 months (62%) while the remainder had PSA doubling time of 6-12 months. The median absolute PSA value was 3.8 ng/mL (interquartile range 1.8 to 9.6 ng/mL). The majority of patients had Gleason grade 7 or lower (73%) with 26% having Gleason grade 8 or higher. Nearly 90% (89.3%) of patients had curative-intent treatment before inclusion.
##### ![null](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology/cf5a523edbd945788f3087570547451e.png)
#### Over a median following up of 36 months, progression within 5 years occurred in 46% of all patients with metastasis in 15% and death in 10%. Among those with no progression, median follow-up was longer at 47 months.
#### Using the authors' aggregate definition of progression-free survival, they found significantly improved [[PFS]] for patients who receiving bicalutamide plus docetaxel as compared to bicalutamide alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.99).
##### ![](https://amyken.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/Urology/d4af0caca3d14f95b5ddc4327d0df447.png)

#### In subgroup analysis, this effect was consistent for patients who had or did not have previous curative-intent treatment, for those with PSA doubling time less than 6 months of 6-12 months, and those aged younger than 68 years or 68 years and older.
#### Assessing safety outcomes, the authors found that 70% of patients received at least 6 cycles of docetaxel with a median of 7 cycle administered. 45 patients representing 26% of the study cohort experience neutropenic fever or infection as a serious adverse event and 85 (62% of randomized patients) terminated [[docetaxel]] treatment as a result of adverse events or serious adverse events.
#### Dr. Josefsson concluded by highlighting that ^^the addition of [[docetaxel]] to bicalutamide reduced time to progression by 28%.^^ Whether this translates into differences in metastasis-free survival or overall survival will require a longer follow-up of this study cohort.
#### Given the changes in the treatment landscape, including the approval of [[enzalutamide]], [[apalutamide]], and [[darolutamide]] in this disease space due to proven benefits in metastasis-free survival (and, more recently at this years ASCO meeting, in overall survival), it is unclear how the demonstrated benefits in progression-free survival here will translate into clinical decision making. However, it is worth noting that patients in the control arms of the trials of androgen receptor agents received placebo rather than the first generation non-steroidal antiandrogen administered in this trial.

### [[EAU 2020]] : Treatment of Polymetastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer
#### (UroToday.com) At the prostate cancer session at the virtual EAU 2020 annual meeting, Chris Sweeney, MBBS, discussed the treatment of polymetastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. To start his presentation, he clarified several important definitions:

*   Hormone/Castration sensitive vs. Hormone/Castration naïve: some men have prior adjuvant hormonal therapy (not all are naïve), and the patient community does not like the word “castration”. Dr. Sweeney’s preferred term is metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer ([[mHSPC]])
*   Androgen deprivation therapy ([[ADT]]) or hormone therapy: There are many versions of testosterone suppression, including testosterone alone, with a weak or potent androgen receptor inhibitor (an ‘amide), or with extragonadal androgen synthesis inhibition (abiraterone)
*   There are different versions of monotherapy and combined androgen blockade
#### Definitions matter when used to guide the counselling and treatment of patients, whether it is prognostic and/or predictive. “Oligometastatic” has generated much interest and investigation: at the [APCCC19 meeting](https://www.urotoday.com/conference-highlights/apccc-2019.html), 79% of the expert consensus voted to be able to deliver ablative therapy with curative intent/hope.1 “Poly-metastatic” disease is high volume (>3 bone mets and/or liver mets) vs low volume (extensive nodes not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy). **Indeed, there are many versions of [[mHSPC]] , including de novo presentation (high vs low volume) or metachronous presentation (high vs low volume).**
#### Ultimately, patients with [[mHSPC]] have variable outcomes with testosterone suppression. Combining data from [[CHAARTED]] and [[GETU15]] (high volume disease being defined as visceral metastases and/or 4 or more bone metastases with at least one beyond the vertebra and pelvis), the median OS outcomes are as follows:

*   Prior local therapy and low volume disease: ~8 years
*   Prior local therapy and high volume disease: 4.5 years
*   De novo and low volume disease: 4.5 years
*   De novo and high volume disease: 3 years
#### The spectrum of patients with [[mHSPC]] varies – one extreme is the 55-year-old man with no comorbidities and high-volume de novo metastatic disease, and the other extreme is the 82-year-old man with CHF and CAD with two bone metastases 10 years after a radical prostatectomy. Indeed, these two examples call for different treatment paradigms. Dr. Sweeney’s guidance for polymetastatic disease in 2020 is as follows:

1.  Docetaxel versus an ‘amide versus abiraterone depends on fitness for chemotherapy, fitness for apalutamide/enzalutamide (no seizure, no frailty), and fitness for abiraterone (blood sugar, hypertension, liver function)
2.  Evidence of consistent [[overall survival]] benefit for a given setting with use of a given agent with no decrement in quality of life on therapy
3.  If chemofit and high volume (and not in the COVID pandemic): docetaxel should be considered at the time of testosterone suppression or at CRPC after abiraterone or an ‘amide, and we should consider giving docetaxel first when the patient is most fit
4.  If chemofit and low volume disease not amenable to surgery or radiotherapy: there is consistent evidence for an ‘amide/abiraterone, with less consistency for docetaxel (but don’t forget about docetaxel for mCRPC)
#### As follows is a high-level summary of all data for testosterone suppression +/- docetaxel for mHSPC:  
![](https://www.urotoday.com/images/mHSPC_testosterone_suppression.png)

Dr. Sweeney encourages a closer look at the fine print behind the “mixed” results:

*   [[GETUG15]] – was conducted in an era with minimal access to agents other than docetaxel for CRPC. Furthermore, this data shows that the Kaplan Meier curves for de novo low volume disease are overlapping and is based on retrospective scan data on all patients. Importantly, the outcomes of low and high volume subgroups are homogeneous with [[CHAARTED]]
*   [[CHAARTED]] – is the only study with prospective stratification by volume of disease
*   [[STAMPEDE]] – is missing scan data on 24% of the patients in retrospective volume analysis and does not include any patients with metachronous low volume disease
#### The bottom line according to Dr. Sweeney is that probably some patients with low volume de novo metastatic disease do have a benefit from chemotherapy but not large enough to see a clear treatment effect across all trials.
#### Additionally, even patients with high volume disease do not necessarily derive a benefit from chemotherapy, thus we need biomarkers to personalize treatment.
#### Two additional points are that
##### (i) it is unknown if there is any treatment effect with docetaxel (or the ‘amides/abiraterone) in low volume disease after radiation to the primary if the patient is de novo metastatic,
##### and (ii) there is no data to suggest any benefit with docetaxel in metachronous low volume disease.
#### Looking at abiraterone by volume of disease, the [[LATITUDE]] study (with the [[CHAARTED]] definition for volume) showed a benefit in high volume disease for abiraterone (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.74), but no benefit for low volume patients (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47-1.10). Looking at the [[STAMPEDE]] abiraterone arm, patients receiving abiraterone had significantly improved OS (low-risk hazard HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.98) and failure-free survival (low-risk HR 0.24, 95% CI 0.17-0.33) compared with ADT alone.2
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: 5f2a9bf7-457d-4ba8-88b3-220b63ae3f46
   :END:

#### Additionally, heterogeneity of effect was not seen between low- and high-risk groups for overall survival or failure-free survival. Enzalutamide in the [[ENZAMET]] study3 showed an OS benefit for enzalutamide (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52-0.85), but is a bit of a mixed bag with regards to de novo vs metachronous, the fact that many patients received concurrent docetaxel and other permutations. At the interim analysis, there was a clear OS benefit in low volume patients and patients who did not get docetaxel; 71% of patients with high volume disease got docetaxel, thus less of an enzalutamide benefit with short-term follow-up (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.59-1.07). Among the patients with low volume disease, 37% received docetaxel, and there was a clear benefit to enzalutamide (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.26-0.72)
#### As follows is an excellent summary of treatment benefit for overall survival in [[mHSPC]]:
##### ![](https://www.urotoday.com/images/treatment_benefit_OS_mHSPC.png)
#### Dr. Sweeney concluded that when deciding on which systemic therapy for which patient with [[mHSPC]], it is important to:

*   Decide if they are chemo-fit or not chemo-fit
*   Delineate whether they have a low or high burden of [[mHSPC]]
*   Look at all of the data to define treatment burden versus treatment benefit for a given subgroup
*   Engage the patient in treatment choice: some chemo-fit patients with high volume disease may want to get chemotherapy out of the way; some patients may want to avoid chemotherapy in the COVID pandemic; if important to avoid (eg. chemophobia or hormonophilia)
